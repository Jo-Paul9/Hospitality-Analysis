# Hospitality Analysis Hotel Performance Insights
Welcome to the Hospitality Analytics Project, a data-driven exploration designed to help hotel owners, managers, and decision-makers understand how their business is performing across booking platforms, room categories, revenue streams, and customer behavior.

Driven by curiosity and a passion for solving real business problems, this project focuses on turning hotel data into clear, actionable insights that help optimize operations and improve profitability.

# Why This Project?
Hotels today interact with multiple booking channels such as Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb, direct website bookings, walk-ins, and more.
But many hotels struggle to answer critical questions:

- Which platform brings the most revenue?
- Which platforms bring high cancellations or low-value bookings?
- What are the main revenue drivers across seasons, segments, or room types?
- Where is the hotel losing money or under-performing?
- Which operational issues are pulling performance down?

This analysis was created to help address exactly those challenges.

# Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to:

- Evaluate booking performance across different online travel agencies (OTAs) and direct/indirect channels.
- Identify key revenue drivers (e.g., room type, ADR, RevPAR, GOPPAR, total bookings, occupancy trends, seasonality).
- Discover weak points in booking sources or operational processes.
- Provide actionable insights to support data-driven decision making for hotel leadership.
- Present results through clean visuals, dashboards, and concise interpretations.

# What You Will Find in This Repository

- Clean and transformed hotel booking dataset
- Power BI or Excel interactive dashboards
- Analytical scripts (DAX)
- Insight summaries highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities

# Vision/Purpose

This project reflects a growing curiosity about the hospitality industry and a strong desire to help hotels make smarter, more confident decisions using data. With the right insight, any hotel—big or small—can uncover hidden opportunities and improve guest experience while maximizing revenue.


# Glossary of terms:

ADR - Average Daily Rate
RevPAR - Revenue Per Available Room
DBRN - Daily Booked Room Nights
DSRN - Daily Sellable Room Nights
DURN - Daily Utilized Room Nights

# Executive Summary:

The hotel portfolio demonstrates strong demand volumes (135K bookings, 274K guests) but faces critical inefficiencies in revenue optimization, channel profitability, and occupancy consistency.
Revenue is heavily dependent on “others” platforms and Premium/Elite rooms and shows fluctuations driven by weekdays/weekends.
Guest behavior shows high check-out success, but notable cancellations (24.8%) and no-shows (5%), representing large leakage in potential revenue.
Overall, the operation is growing, but profitability is constrained by channel inefficiencies, inventory underutilization, and inconsistent pricing strategies.

# Revenue Drivers: 

- Elite ($560M) & Premium ($462M) Rooms dominate revenue.
- Luxury & Business categories split revenue at 38.4% vs 61.6%, meaning business travelers are the primary revenue engine.
- Weekend ADR ($12,725) > Weekday ADR ($12,683), meaning weekends outperform slightly in ADR, but the difference is minimal, suggesting pricing power is not being maximized on peak days.
- Overall occupancy 57.9%, where weekend is 62.6% and weekday is 56%. This indicates weekends are stronger, weekdays demand generation is weak, hence, a lot of rooms remain unoccupied during business days.
- Operational leakages like Cancellation rate 24.8% (extremely high), No-Show rate 5.0%, Check-Out Success 70.1%. Thus, combining cancellation & no-shows creates 30% loss of potential revenue, showing inadequate deposit policies and guest compliance.

# Risk Assessment:

- Over-reliance on a single segment (“others”) is dangerous. Over 40% of revenue comes from a non-transparent bucket.
- Direct channels (online + offline) together produce $255M, which is only 23% of total platform revenue, showing weak brand pull. Hence, increasing direct bookings can improve margin by eliminating commission losses.

# Key Strengths:

- Elite & Premium dominate revenues.
- Business category contributes 61.6% → indicates strong loyalty & pricing resilience.
- ADR around $12.7K consistently, Realization at 70% is healthy.

# Key Weakness & Risks:

- High Cancellation & No-Show Rates: Showing over 30% of booking loss rate - massive revenue leakage.
- Overdependence on “others” contributing ~$700M. Direct channel revenue is extremely weak
- Inconsistent weekly trend indicates a weak demand strategy

# Strategic Recommendations:

- Launch loyalty app & website promo rates
- Offer perks only in direct channels (free breakfast, free cancellations)
- Reduce dependency on OTAs, especially “others”
- Reduce Cancellations & No-Shows by introducing tiered cancellation policy, and offer rebooking incentives instead of refunds.
- Target business travelers through (Corporate tie-ups, work-from-hotel packages, Long-stay discounts, Shuttle/airport partnerships etc.).
- Strengthen Low-Performing Channels like Journey, Direct Offline, and Logtrip with better commission negotiations targeted promo codes etc.
- Implement (Dynamic pricing by day-type, Event-based surge pricing, and Weekly demand forecasting) in order to improve revenue management.
