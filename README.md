# Hospitality Analysis Hotel Performance Insights
Welcome to the Hospitality Analytics Project, a data-driven exploration designed to help hotel owners, managers, and decision-makers understand how their business is performing across booking platforms, room categories, revenue streams, and customer behavior.

Driven by curiosity and a passion for solving real business problems, this project focuses on turning hotel data into clear, actionable insights that help optimize operations and improve profitability.

# Why This Project?
Hotels today interact with multiple booking channels such as Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb, direct website bookings, walk-ins, and more.
But many hotels struggle to answer critical questions:

- Which platform brings the most revenue?
- Which platforms bring high cancellations or low-value bookings?
- What are the main revenue drivers across seasons, segments, or room types?
- Where is the hotel losing money or under-performing?
- Which operational issues are pulling performance down?

This analysis was created to help address exactly those challenges.

# Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to:

- Evaluate booking performance across different online travel agencies (OTAs) and direct/indirect channels.
- Identify key revenue drivers (e.g., room type, ADR, RevPAR, GOPPAR, total bookings, occupancy trends, seasonality).
- Discover weak points in booking sources or operational processes.
- Provide actionable insights to support data-driven decision making for hotel leadership.
- Present results through clean visuals, dashboards, and concise interpretations.

# What You Will Find in This Repository
- Clean and transformed hotel booking dataset
- Power BI or Excel interactive dashboards
- Analytical scripts (DAX)
- Insight summaries highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities

# Vision/Purpose
This project reflects a growing curiosity about the hospitality industry and a strong desire to help hotels make smarter, more confident decisions using data. With the right insight, any hotel—big or small—can uncover hidden opportunities and improve guest experience while maximizing revenue.
